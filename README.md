The Salary Tracker is introduction code to calculate
employees salary base on a limit salary, for this
example used a LATAM salary so you will see 2000000
as a reference value for salary increase.

Code has comments section and a code section where
all the logic resides.

A single menu to enter to the project logic and
employee creation with some initial validation

Version 1.0 - Stores the employees information in
a dictionary during the program execution and
there is not permante data store.
